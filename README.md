# Summer-Project-Physics-informed-Learning
This repository contains all of my codes (and data) as a summer research intern in the Learning and Control Group of Carnegie Mellon University, led by Prof. Yorie Nakahira. I am working on the project- Physics-informed learning for safe control and reinforcement learning, under the supervision of Mr. Jacob Wamg.
